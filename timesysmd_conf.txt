Entries in this file show the compile time defaults. Local configuration
should be created by either modifying this file (or a copy of it placed
in /etc/ if the original file is shipped in /usr/), or by creating "drop-ins"
in the /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/ directory. The latter is generally
recommended. Defaults can be restored by simply deleting the main
configuration file and all drop-ins located in /etc/.

Use 'systemd-analyze cat-config systemd/timesyncd.conf' to display

See timesyncd.conf(5) for details.
